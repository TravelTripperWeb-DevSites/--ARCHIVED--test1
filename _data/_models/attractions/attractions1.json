We went at lunch time and when we arrived there was a line out the door. Not a long one and we were inside within five minutes. Once inside you are given a ticket and told not to lose it or you will be charged a fine. There are seats where you can be helped by a waiter and there was a wait, so we did counter service. Counter service consisted of choosing one of several lines and waiting. Once you get to the front you order and the service is quick and efficient. I ordered a Reuben sandwich with pastrami and a matzo ball soup, both of which were excellent. the biggest problem during this visit was finding a place to sit. after walking around for about 5 minutes we were able to squeeze in where a family had left. Despite the crowds I would go back to Katz's many times.",

I ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was huge but not especially good. The old world feel was charming but I think it's just a modern tourist trap with $24 sandwiches that are just okay tasting. It's a really good amount of food and I wouldn't recommend ordering a whole one unless you're a big eater or splitting it.",

What makes this place so special is that it is an authentic New York experience that everyone should try once in their lifetime. \n When you walk through the door you are greeted with a ticket that you must guard with your life.  If you lose it there is a $50 penalty.  Next you are asked whether you want table service .  If not you are directed to one of 7 lines to stand and wait to order your meal.  Once you get to your Carver the tradition is to tip him in exchange for a taste of pastrami, or corn beef or whatever it is you order.   Pickles are served with your sandwich all for the low low price of $22.45.  \nOne sandwich is definitely enough for 2 people.   Next time you are on Houston on the Lower East Side make sure to stop by Katz's Deli. \nCredit card is accepted",
